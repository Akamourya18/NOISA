## üíô Introduction
### NOISA
NOISA stands for No Invasive Site Animations. It is a browser extension developed for people with photosensitive epilepsy and vestibular disorders, for making web surfing accessible and inclusive! 

### What are Vestibular Disorders?
Any disease, damage, or injury to the vestibular system‚Äîthe system around our inner ear and brain that processes sensory information involved in controlling balance and eye movements‚Äîfalls under the umbrella of a vestibular disorder.

## üí° Problem it solves
Websites contain potential triggering animations and features for people suffering from vestibular disorders. With a purposeful regulation over motions and animations, the user takes control of how to render the content, making web surfing more accessible.

A user will have control over the following aspects:

## üå∫ Scalability

The project can be scaled to fulfill huge possibilities. The current scalable paths comprise of :
#### Reader Mode
- Zoom in/out 
- Generous line spacing / leading.
- Avoiding contrast and small font size.

#### Aspect Ration Adding game
- A screen size ranging between 19 and 22 inches is  helpful for a person with a vestibular disorder who writes and edits documents.
